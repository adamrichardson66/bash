# bash

This is a repository for some command line programs. 

In particular there is a number visualizer that uses ImageMagick where you can visualize any rational number as an array of pixels colored according to the digit in the decimal representation (1 pixel per 1 digit). For rational numbers, just enter the quotient where promtped in the code. For irrational numbers you need a .txt file of some number of digits of an approximation to rrational number. In this repository I've included .txt files for the first 1,000,000 digits of pi, e, phi (golden ratio, sqrt{2}, and sqrt{3}. Try it out! It is an excellent way to *see* the difference between rational and irrational numbers. Note: you must have ImageMagick installed to run that code.
